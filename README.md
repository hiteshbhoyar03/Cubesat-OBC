The Onboard Computer (OBC) is the central control unit of the CubeSat system, designed for low-power operation, robust interfacing, and modular telemetry/command handling. It serves as the core data and control hub, interfacing with sensors and subsystems over multiple buses including SPI, I2C, UART, and CAN.

> 🚀 This design emphasizes embedded systems learning, modular subsystem interaction, and reliable firmware development for space applications.
